#### Problems:
* "Cold" start allways forces LLM to execute once with NO messages but Message.System(which is defined in AIAgent 
  Config)
* Evaluations pretend to mock message history; however, standalone strategies are not mocked from tool calls. 

#### Prerequisites

- Tavily-MCP(currently with local MCP Server):
```shell
npx -y tavily-mcp@latest
```
